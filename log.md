# 100 Days Of Code - Log
------
## Day 1: November 9, 2022
### Working with Strings - 01

**Today's Progress**: Creating a Program that read a name or a text and transform every first word to upper case

**Thoughts:** It was very useful because i was able to work with some different methods even in a simple example.

*Methods that were used and others:*
1. `split()`
2. `replace()`
3. `toUpperCase()`
4. `join()`
5. `for of loop`

### Working with Strings - 02

**Today's Progress**: Program that read a credit card number and hide all the numbers but the last four

**Thoughts:** Simple example but with a real case working with very interesting methods;

*Methods that were used and others:*
1. `slice()`
2. `padStart()`
3. `type coersion`

## Day 2: November 10, 2022
### Using Default Parameters

**Today's Progress**: Program that simulate booking a flight.

**Thoughts:** 
1. `Sometimes is useful to have functions where some parameters have default values.`
2. `Default parameters accepts any expressions`
3. `Accepts other parameter that were set before it`
4. `Use undefined as argument to skip a parameter and leave it with the default value`

## Day 3: November 11, 2022
### Map - JavaScript Data Structure

**Today's Progress**: Simulating a quiz using Map as a Data Structure

**Thoughts:** 
Maps are a new data structure in JavaScript that allows us to store data with key value pairs, similar to Objects. But the biggest difference is that in Objects, the type of the keys are always strings, however ***in Maps the keys can have any type*** and it can gave to us a lot of possibilities.

Maps has also moderns methods that brings efficiency to it and as Sets, Maps can't also have duplicated values.

Used in the program:

1. `.get()`
2. `Destruct`
3. `Map Iteration using for of loop`
