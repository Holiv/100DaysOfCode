### Working with Strings - 01

**Today's Progress**: Creating a Program that read a name or a text and transform every first word to upper case

*Methods that were used and others:*
1. `split()`
2. `replace()`
3. `toUpperCase()`
4. `join()`
5. `for of loop`

*Methods that were used and others:*
1. `slice()`

## Day 2: November 10, 2022
### Using Default Parameters

**Today's Progress**: Program that simulate booking a flight.

**Thoughts:** 
1. `Sometimes is useful to have functions where some parameters have default values.`
2. `Default parameters accepts any expressions`
3. `Accepts other parameter that were set before it`
4. `Use undefined as argument to skip a parameter and leave it with the default value`
